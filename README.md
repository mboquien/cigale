CIGALE means Code Investigating GALaxy Emission. The code has been developed to study the evolution of galaxies by comparing modelled galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to observed ones from the X-rays and far ultraviolet to the far infra-red and radio. The git repository is on our [Gitlab](https://gitlab.lam.fr/cigale/cigale/) but you can use Github for discussions and bug reports if you desire.
